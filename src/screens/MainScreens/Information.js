    Answer: `Covid-19 is a viral infection spread from person to person. Do not stigmatise people who have 

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

Stay home if you feel unwell. 

Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an

alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.

Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. 

To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. 

To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. 
 
If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance TO THE HELPLINE.
